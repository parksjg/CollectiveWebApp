# Collective
**Secure Story Sharing Webapp**

The Collective web application will enable the sharing of encrypted text among users of the system. All text will be encrypted and inaccessible for the admin. A user can enter and store text associated with their username into the database. This text is only unencrypted for the user who owns it, but the user who owns it can also share access to the unencrypted text to other users by their username. The owner can also remove the access granted to other users. In this way, we have a secure information sharing platform. I imagine writers, journalists, doctors, and scientists using the Collective web app to share their ideas and works in progress with their peers. In return the Collective web app would ensure the security of userâ€™s data. The users own their data, Collective provides the service of keeping that data private, even from Collective itself.
